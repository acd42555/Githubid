<H4>How I got involved</H4>
	<p> During the summer of my 10th grade year of High School, I 
	decided to attend a summer camp at IMG Academy for golf. I heard 
	about IMG Academy from my brother who attended a summer camp for
	tennis while he was still in High School. When I arived at IMG 
	for the camp, I was very imtimidated because this place felt
	like a college and everybody seemed to be very good at their sport.
	However, when I finally got adjusted to everything, this place became a 
	dream! I loved every second of that camp and was dying to stay
	longer. On my last day of camp, I was excited to see my family, but was ]
	sad that I had to leave. When I was practicing with my coach, he told me
	that the head director wanted to see me in his office. When I met 
	with him, he told me that my coach was very impressed by me and 
	wanted me to offically stay and play golf for their school. This 
	was one of the best feelings of my life, that I finally got a 
	great oppurtunity to improve my skill level year round at the 
	greatest sports academy in the country.

<H4>My Full Time Experience! </H4>
	<p> I attended IMG Academy my last two years of high school. 
	Throught those two years, I managed to make life long friends 
	from countries all areound the world, train beside the greatest
	atlelets in the country, and earn a full ride scholorship to play
	golf for Young Harris College. Those two years really changed 
	my life in more ways than I could every imagine. The IMG Academy 
	experience will allow you to surround yourself with so many 
	people with the same mindset and goals as you. If someone ever
	has the chance to go to a camp or be lucky enough to go to school
	their, I would tell them to take full advantage of everything they 
	have to offer and don't waist a second of it. Here is a table showing
	my weekly schedule:
